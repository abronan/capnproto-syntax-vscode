# capnproto-syntax for vscode

A most basic syntax highlighter for *.capnp* schema files, to save the day...

Project page: https://github.com/abronan/capnproto-syntax-vscode

## Limitations

This *only* supports syntax highlighting, there is no support for completion or more advanced features. I made this solely for my own use, to cheer up with colors while editing schema files. I don't intend to extend or maintain it in any way. Feel free to fork and add more features.
